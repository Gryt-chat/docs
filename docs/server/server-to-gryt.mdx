# The solar system

How exactly does your self-hosted server connect to gryt and what information is shared between each node?

### The layers

Gryt conists of three layers:
- The solar system (Gryt's official servers used for authentication and server listing)
- Planets (Self-hosted Gryt servers, with an admin panel)
- Moons (Communities within planets, created by users that are admins of a planet. These can be accessed through the client)

#### The solar system

The solar system will provide you with user-authentication and a global server list. In short the solar system collects as little information about each user, and only provides the user with a list of available **public** servers.

#### User authentication

The solar system's user authentication is used to store basic information about users, such as their email, password and a list of servers they have joined. The information about your user is not shared with anyone, and planets cannot obtain this information.
Planets can only request confirmation from the solar system when a user wishes to do an action that requires specific permissions.

The reason we keep a list of servers that the user is a part of is so the client knows which servers to connect to after authenticating.

#### Global server list

The global server list acts like a community-center. You can browse servers if they are configured to be public
